You read Software Job boards. There are not that many true Entry Level openings advertised. A typical Junior Software Developer position requires a degree and 1-3 years of relevant experience. For those who have real experience, the degree requirement would be optional, of course, these days. Why do employers require a degree and experience? To lower their risks:

- Employers don’t want to spend time interviewing someone who won’t fit anyway

- Employers don’t want to hire a fake

There is no science behind the “years of experience” requirement. On the lower end, it is used to discourage unqualified applicants, and on the higher end (not that important for you right now, but still) to encourage those who invested years and years of their life into the skill that it will be appreciated if they apply.
