In a technology-centered industry, in order to become strategic, you must understand and be comfortable with the tactics. 

No other role will give you the necessary exposure to the deep layers of technology as the Developer role will. This doesnâ€™t mean you should pass a chance to get your first Software job in another role, but you should focus on getting a Developer job first and then move in the direction you find workable and attractive.
