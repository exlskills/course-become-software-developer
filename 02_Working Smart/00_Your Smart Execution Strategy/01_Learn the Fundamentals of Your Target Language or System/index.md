Staying focused on your current goal, limit your learning plan to the system and technology set you identified as the one that should get you a job at the potential employers on your list. Learn the fundamentals, any applicable theory, and best practices as relates to your target. Don’t generalize at this point. Remember, Software Development is a narrow-focused discipline, especially at the entry level. You’ll have plenty of time to expand your horizons after getting a job.

Get the “what,” “why,” and “how” of your technology (more on w-w-h later) and don’t worry about lining up the stuff you learn against that in other technologies or generic CS.

As mentioned above, it is highly unlikely that your Software Developer career will revolve around one system – the one that you get your first professional job on. Be ready to move from system to system every few years at the longest. Don’t develop a mental attachment to them: learn them, understand them, and move on to different ones when the demand and opportunities change.

In the sports fan analogy: you grow up rooting for your hometown team, then you move and find yourself living in a town with a much better one that everyone around you roots for. Will you switch your allegiance?
