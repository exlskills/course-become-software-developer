When you’re on your own schedule vs. following semester calendar at a college or serving weeks at a bootcamp, the time you lose in learning is literally taken away from your future job’s pay-stub and experience building.

With the overwhelming number of online courses and materials – stay away from generic consolidators and canned courses recorded by someone you’ll never be able to get in touch with to clarify things that are skipping you. Pass on CS-centered courses as many of those target graduation requirements vs. professional practice. If later in your career you decide to stick with technology and expand yourself into architect-like roles – then check those CS courses out. Their content will probably remain exactly as it is now, so you can wait, no rush.

As pointed out above, you’re the one who does the learning, and the professionals working for your target employers are your ultimate examiners. Go with materials put together by professionals and find access to professionals to answer your questions and guide you through putting together your portfolio projects.
