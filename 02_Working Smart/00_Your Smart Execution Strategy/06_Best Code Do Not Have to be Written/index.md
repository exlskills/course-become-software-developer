You might have read that “Every program contains at least one bug.” All written code must be typed in, tested, deployed, and maintained. If you can craft a working solution without writing much code you’re saving a lot of effort, both short and long term. The code is an enabler of a solution, but it is also the foe of it. 

Keep that in mind! Go from business to technology.
