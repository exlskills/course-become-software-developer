Despite the well-known fact that a good developer is orders of magnitude better than a not-so-good one, there is only so much salary increase that can be attached to an individual contributor developer’s position. So, eventually, you become too expensive for what you do – unless you start doing something else. That can be management, business, sales, or specialized consulting. 

In a technology-rich environment, you can also move along the tech path from developer to architect - if you feel that you have the level of devotion and acceptance of pure software technology at the high mark where a successful architect must be; get through those CS courses then.
