Your Portfolio is a set of solutions that you implemented and it is the centerpiece demonstrating your technical knowledge and skills. Hardly anyone writes code from scratch these days, so borrow as much as you need, but make sure you can explain every piece and component of the end product: what does it do, why it’s needed, and how it works.

Get yourself in the professional habit of recording the time you spent working on each task and have it handy as well. The goal is to show how fast you can produce results, but don’t hide productivity drop-offs – an issue analyzed, explained, and corrected is your gain, not loss.

Your portfolio is where you present yourself acting as a Software Professional.
