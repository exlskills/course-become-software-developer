Big name hot software companies - just a subset of the many industries where Software Professional jobs are.

There are three general categories of Software jobs by the target work effort:

- Business or scientific function support within an organization (“Internal IT”)

- Software product development (“Vendor”)

- External customers support via project delivery (“Consulting”)

All three would evolve around similar software and technologies, but the day-to-day of the roles can be quite different: the size of the team, interaction with non-technical personnel and business processes, development and testing cycles, prevailing methodologies, etc.

And, of course, startups vs. established organizations.

Just like with switching roles, a technologist would commonly move between those industry categories once or more during his/her career.
