Having the right attitude, being a team player, communicating well, identifying and solving issues, following processes, and suggesting improvements; those things have very little to do with Software theory and skills, but they hugely affect one’s employability and career advancement. 

Ironically, those are called “soft skills”. Soft skills are harder to acquire, maintain, and demonstrate than Software skills. Think what soft skills you’ve gained in your career already, document them in a meaningful and provable way, and use them to your advantage to get hired ahead of those software-theory-only skilled recent graduates who may fill entry-level positions.
